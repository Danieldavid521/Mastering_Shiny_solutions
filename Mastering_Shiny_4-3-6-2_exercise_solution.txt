# Question:
# Can the reactive graph contain a cycle? Why/why not?

# Answer:
# Yes, this is a possibility in reactive applications. "In graph theory, a cycle in a graph is a non-empty trail in which the only repeated vertices are the first and last vertices"(1).
# An example of this is a formula that depends on 3 variables to be able to 
# calculate a number. A Cycle is when there is an a non-empty dependency between nodes.
